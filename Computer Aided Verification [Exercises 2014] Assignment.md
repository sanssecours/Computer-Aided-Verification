1. Show the results about lfp on slides 4 and 5 of alecture3.pdf

2. Show that no LTL formula can express AG EF p

3. Show the definition of AU on slide 16 of alecture2.pdf

4. Prove or disprove that the results on slide 16 or alecture2.pdf also hold with fairness constraints.

5. Implement a solver for the Rubik's cube in SMV or SPIN. Idea: Implement the moves of the cube as nondeterministic steps. Specify that the solution is not reachable, and let the model checker compute a solution as a counterexample to this specification.

6. Find a translation of the U operator to propositional logic in bounded model checking

7. Show that all LTL properties have counterexamples which are either finite paths or finite paths with a loop.

8. Give an LTL specification where the smallest counterexample is larger than the number of states in the Kripke structure.

9. Show how you can use SMV to solve chess problems. "Given a chess board, white has a winning strategy in 3 moves.". How do you describe the board? What is the specification?
